**Analysis and Prediction of Customer Loan Defaults Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

This report focuses on analyzing and predicting customer loan defaults from a dataset originating from Taiwan, using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of future default. The dataset includes variables such as granted credit, gender, education, age, and payment history. After conducting exploratory data analysis, the dataset will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the SVM model, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix. The results will guide recommendations to improve the model, supporting financial institutions in risk management and credit recovery strategies.

**Key Steps and Operations:**

*Data Loading and Preparation:*

- The dataset is loaded from an Excel file.
- Features (X) and the target variable (y) are separated, and the data is split into training and test sets.

*SVM with Cross-Validation:*

- A Support Vector Machine model with an RBF kernel is trained on the training set and tested on the test set.
- Cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance (accuracy).

*ShuffleSplit and KFold Cross-Validation:*

- Various cross-validation methods such as ShuffleSplit and KFold are employed to ensure robust model evaluation.
- Feature standardization is added using StandardScaler.

*Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV:*

- GridSearchCV is used to optimize the SVM model's hyperparameters (C and gamma) across a range of values.
- Nested cross-validation is applied to select the best hyperparameters.

*Final Evaluation and Ensemble:*

- The best models obtained from cross-validation are evaluated, and the confusion matrix is computed.
- An ensemble of predictions is generated by taking the mode of model predictions to improve classification robustness.

*Evaluation Metrics:*
- Metrics such as Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score are calculated using the confusion matrix to assess model performance.
